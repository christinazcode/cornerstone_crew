## **What: Problem Statement**

Build a vehicle sharing platform that optimizes fleet distribution and utilization through demand prediction and intelligent resource allocation.

---

## **Core Business Model**

- **Subscription Service** offering (recurring revenue model)
- **Hub & Spoke Architecture** for physical distribution
- **Priority User Focus**: 1,000 loyal users > 10,000 casual users

---

## **Key Capability: Demand Prediction & Optimization**

**Input Signals:**

- Traffic patterns and population movement
- Busy times/locations identification
- Event data (sporting events, concerts)
- Daily commuter behavior

**Output Goals:**

- Right vehicle type at right location/time
- Proactive fleet repositioning
- Reduced idle time and wasted resources

## **Vehicle & Battery Management System**

### Small Vehicles (Battery-Swappable)

- Distributed battery swap at hub locations
- Battery monitoring to predict depletion
- Service center notification system (low battery alerts)
- Back-office app for swap operations
- Optimized routing for battery swap logistics

### Large Vehicles (Plug-in Charging)

- Central charging stations (spoke locations)
- Potential cross-vehicle charging (larger → smaller)
- Pickup/dropoff at charging hubs

---

## **User Growth Strategy**

- Social media marketing
- AI-driven targeted marketing
- Quality-focused retention (vs. volume acquisition)

---

## **Non-Functional Requirements**

- Data privacy compliance (GDPR)
- User privacy protection
- Data restriction adherence

---

## **Architecture Questions to Explore:**

- Real-time vs. batch prediction systems?
- Mobile app + back-office app scope?
- Event data integration (external APIs)?
- Analytics platform for battery/usage patterns?
