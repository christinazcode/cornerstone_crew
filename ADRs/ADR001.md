# ADR 001: Inventory Prediction: Data Freshness - how frequently to update weather/events data
## Context
We need to decide if we should pull the external data like weather, events information once a day vs more frequently. MobilityCorp's business is highly transactional. They rely on short rental timeframes. While pulling data once a day (or less frequently) will be less costly, updating this data more frequently will improve accuracy vastly.<br><br>
## Decision
We decided to pull data once an hour and only during the work day (8 - 5). Even though this will incur more costs, the accuracy that this provides will far outweigh the cost benefits of refreshing data once a day.
