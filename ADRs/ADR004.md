# ADR 004: Optimization and Prediction vs just optimization
## Context
Should we only provide route optimization based on demand and fleet availability or should the system be able to predict routes? While route optimization is a first step, this doesn't offer the added value that comes with prediction that enables the company to move fleet vehicles to locations and preplan routes for future<br><br>
## Decision
We decided to include both optimization and route prediction with the model. The added value of prediction means that the company can run much leaner and do not need to invest in human schedulers to plan routes. One thing we decided not to include is dynamic route planning based on predicted traffic patterns. We are assuming that any traffic patterns will be reoccurring and that these will be accounted for in the current model's "acutal route" parameters that are being fed into it.
