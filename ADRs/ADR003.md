# ADR003: Battery Swap Prediction: Real time vs batch prediction
## Context
Should the prediction happen in real time or should there be a batch process that runs at given intervals to produce an updated prediction? While real time prediction is more accurate, it can also be extermely resource intensive since one of the inputs to the model is the output of another model (inventory management prediction). <br><br>
## Decision
Decision has been made to use batch processing and update the battery results once every 3 hours. MobilityCorp's business is highly transactional however, updating battery swap predictions every minute doesn't make sense and will not help the business much as the trucks that carry batteries cannot pivot and change pre-planned routes constantly
