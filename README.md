## Problem definition
### About MobilityCorp
MobilityCorp is a one stop last mile eco friendly transport rental company operating in Europe. They rent out E-Bikes, E-Scooters, Electric Vans and Cars. Currently operating mostly in cities, they are aiming to expand coverage into suburban areas. While currently successful, MobilityCorp has a big challenge ahead if they want to scale and expand their business. They are unsure of how to manage a potential surge in vehicle and battery inventory, how to manage effectively charge their batteries and make sure the vehicles do not run out of charge during rental and how to minimize loss of vehicles as they look to expand their operations across European cities. They are looking to re-architect their mobile application and backend software to meet these challenges.

## High Level Functional Requirements
### Booking
* Ability to browse and reserve vehicles
  * Choose pick up and drop off locations
  * Ensure that users drop vehicles off at the selected drop off location
* Cars and Vans can be booked 7 days in advance for specific duration
* Bikes and scooters can be booked 30 mins in advance and no specific duration
* Max duration of booking bikes and scooters booking is 12 hours
* Cars and vans should not be made available for booking if they do not have enough charge
* Ability to pre-authorize credit cards prior to booking
### Payments
* Payment is per minute of rental
* Customers should see the rate of vehicles at booking time
* Vehicles being returned at the incorrect location incur fines
### Tracking
* Ability to track where our vehicles are (GPS tracking)
* Ability to remotely lock and unlock vehicles
* Ability for customer to unlock the booked vehicle via NFC device
* Enforce speed limits
### Returning
* Ability to capture photos as proof of return
* Customers should be shown the return location
* Ability to 'force/prompt' customers to plug cars and vans in upon return
* Ability to collect customer feedback on the rental
### Maintenance
* Ability for staff to know which parking bays to visit to swap battery packs for bikes and scooters
* Ability for staff to be notified to move vehicles to popular spots (anticipate need)
* Ability for customers to swap battery during their rental period for extra charge
### Loss Prevention
* <mark>TODO</mark>
## Non-Functional Requirements
* The system must receive data from vehicles at least every 30 seconds; if a different interval is proposed, the team must explain why it's more appropriate.
* The platform must support multiple languages for user interfaces.
* The platform must support multiple currencies for international payments.
* Each country will start with approximately 5,000 bikes, 5,000 scooters, 200 cars, and 200 vans, with most vehicles concentrated around city centers.
* Service will operate through out EU, we need to plan for scaling up

# Solution
## [Architecture Characteristics](diagram/architecture-characteristics.pdf) 
* **Low Latency**: The system must provide an estimated hourly rate for a rental request within 30 seconds of the user's query.
* **Strong Consistency (or Reservation Lock)**: A single rental request must be matched with exactly one available vehicle. This match must be exclusively held (or locked) for that user for 1 minute, during which time the user can accept or decline the offer.
* **Scalability**: The system must be capable of processing 100 transactions per second (TPS), specifically for location updates. It must also be designed to support a 15% growth in this capacity annually for the next five years.</li></ul>

## AI Components
### Context
Pre-trained LLMs are trained on general text, primarily publicly available data. They donâ€™t have knowledge of your private context that is not publicly available. You have the option to retrain them with your private context, which can be time-consuming and expensive. They also become outdated quickly once the next versions of the LLMs are released. RAG is a great way to incorporate your context into the context window of LLMs by indexing your content into a vector database. You can also build an AI agent to call your APIs to get access to your information.

### Pricing Model and Fleet Allocation Model
When MiniCorp starts, we can build a simple interface to guide the rental flow so that we can build up a customer base and collect data. The data collected in the first three months will be used to train two ML models: a pricing model and a fleet allocation model. The pricing model will dynamically calculate prices based on a base rate and any adjustments based on user profile, time of day, day of the week, time of year, etc. The fleet allocation model will determine the location and forecast vehicle needs so that the fleet management service can schedule appropriate tasks for service technicians to allocate the fleet to the appropriate locations to meet customer demand.

### Customer Segmentation

### Agentic Chatbots for Customer Service and Internal Work
As we continue to accumulate data from our business, we can implement chatbots for internal and external users. The internal chatbot helps our employees with onboarding and learning our business. The external chatbot can be part of customer service to help answer users' questions and guide them through the rental journey. These chatbots will be agents that have access to both the vector database of our context and other public APIs to enhance the user journey. For instance, once a user asks a question, the agent can search Google to get information, call our pricing API to get a price estimation for a rental, and call the Google Calendar API to add the booking as an event in the user's calendar.
